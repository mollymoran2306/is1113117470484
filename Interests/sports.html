       <hr>

        <p>I have played hockey since I was 6 with my local club Garyduff. When I was 13 I joined my school hockey team and played with them for 6 years.</br>
        In 2014 our school team won the Junior B Cup. 
        I train twice a week and usually have a match at the weekend. </br> </br>
        I also enjoy swimming and was a member of Sundays Well Swimming Club for 6 years. I trained 3 times a week and attended many swimming galas.
